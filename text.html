     <h2>Information about e-bike and scooter</h2>
        <p>
            There are two schools of thought when it comes to the design of electric vehicles. On the one hand, there are
            people who think that in order to gain mainstream acceptance, the vehicles should look as normal as possible.
            On the other, some people believe that such innovative technology should be reflected with unconventional looks.
            Falling firmly in the latter category are ETT Industries' new Raker electric scooter and Trayser e-bike.
            Both bikes feature a laser-cut monocoque aluminum frame, which won each of them an IF Design Award. Additionally,
            it's possible for owners to 3D print some of the individual plastic components (should they need replacing), such
            as rear mudguards. Powered by a 72V/25-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, the Raker's brushless 2,000W motor can take
            it up to a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). One 5-hour charge from a standard outlet should be good for a range of
            about 50 miles (80 km) of urban use. Other features include front and rear suspension (120 and 27 mm, respectively),
            12 x 3-inch wheels, a full lighting kit, and a total weight of 75 kg (165 lb). It's available for pre-order in a
            choice of four colors, priced at £2,700 (about US$3,855).For riders who prefer to do some pedalling, the Trayser's
            250W rear hub motor takes it to an assisted top speed of 15.5 mph (25 km/h). Depending on the amount of rider input,
            the bike's 42V/20-Ah lithium-ion battery pack should be good for a range of up to 60 miles (97 km) – as with the Raker,
            a full recharge takes five hours. Other features include a belt drive and Tektro disc brakes, but no suspension.
            It tips the scales at 27 kg (60 lb), comes in four colors, and can be pre-ordered for £1,700 (US$2,428).

    <h2>Information about Ducati Multistrada Enduro</h2>
        <p>
            Just when you might have thought Ducati had tweaked the Multistrada 1200 as much as you'd think possible, the
            company took one more stab at it and created an Enduro version. True ADV riders may now have fewer reasons to
            question the Multistrada's offroad capability. Look no farther than a few of the major changes Ducati made to
            make the Enduro far more dirt and long-distance friendly. Start with a bigger gas tank that has gone from the
            20 liters (5.3 gallons) found on the Multistrada 1200 to 30 liters (7.9 gallons) on the Enduro. Ducati claims
            that increased fuel capacity will last you 450 km (280 miles) between fill-ups. That puts the Enduro right in
            line with what you'll find on the KTM 1290 Adventure or the BMW GSA. Aluminum side panels and skidplate, front
            and rear mudguards and an extended beak provide protection from dirt and debris all give the Enduro the intended
            off-road look. Improved off-road control and stability are evident with the addition of a steering damper, 19"
            spoked front and 17" spoked rear wheels, and an interesting addition the company is referring to as Vehicle Hold
            Control, which is said to make fully loaded uphill starts a little easier. Ducati also equipped the Enduro with
            a shell-cast aluminum double-sided swingarm; a distinct departure from the single-side version on the Multistrada.
            The Enduro also has a Bosch ABS system with a 3-level setting to limit braking going into corners, and to provide
            better stopping power in the varied terrain and weather conditions an ADV rider is likely to encounter. Comfort
            was also a focus, so Ducati fitted the front end of the Enduro with a Sachs front fork and a Sachs rear monoshock,
            both of which provide 200 mm (7.9 inches) of travel for optimized off-road use. Compared to the Multristrada 1200
            suspension which provided 170 mm (6.7 inches) of travel front and back, the Enduro is bound to be better at soaking
            up some significant bumps and major backroad divots. Other elements adding to the Enduro's improved ADV worthiness
            include a height-adjustable rear brake lever that can be set for optimal off- or on-road use, an articulated gear
            lever to prevent breakage in the event of a fall, and front footpegs with removable rubber inserts. Ducati gave
            the Enduro the same ride modes available on the Multistrada 1200 S – Touring, Sport, Urban and Enduro. There's
            also an 8-level adjustable traction control and 8-level adjustable wheelie control. Riding the Enduro in Enduro
            mode seems redundant, and we may need some time in the saddle to figure that one out. Fans of the power and
            geometry of the Multistrada will be happy to know Ducati gave the Enduro the same 1198cc Testrastretta engine
            and the frame it sits in. The Ducati Enduro goes on sale in April for European buyers only at a list price of
            £16,690 (about US$23,730) and with plenty of options available to kit it out for a plethora of adventures.
            There's no word as to when it will be available elsewhere in the world.

    <h2>Information about Shoei X Spirit III helmet</h2>
        <p>
            Shoei has always had a reputation for building technologically advanced motorcycle helmets. Its latest flagship
            model, the X-Spirit III, is no exception with improvements in safety, comfort and aerodynamics over previous
            flagship models in the company's premium X-series race helmet lineup. Offered earlier this year as the X-Fourteen
            in North America, the company has taken the same helmet, dubbed it the X-Spirit III, and has now made it available
            to European racers and riders alike. The X-Spirit III features some unique exterior design twists that the
            company said make this one of the most aerodynamic helmets available. The key is in the patent-pending rear
            stabilizer system that features a set of rear flaps that can be replaced with an optional narrower pair that
            allow the rider to make adjustments based on preference and track dynamics. According to Shoei, wind tunnel
            tests indicated the rear stabilizer system reduced lift and drag by 3 percent and 10 percent respectively when
            compared to former X-models. Similar tests showed a 50 percent decrease in yawing, which causes helmet buffeting
            at high speeds. Shoei's designers also took into account how racers will adjust their helmet for better vision
            in sharp lean angles by repositioning the way the helmet sits on their head. To compensate, Shoei incorporated
            an adjustable interior center pad that can be rotated by about four degrees from the standard position. The
            result is more room around the neck and a larger field of vision when leaning at sharp angles in deep corners.
            Ventilation and comfort come in the form of six air intakes and an equal number of exhaust outlets, and a new
            cheek pad cooling system that directs more air to that area of the rider's face. Forehead, rear, side and neck
            padding are fully removable, allowing for a more customized fit and cleaning. Improvements to the shield have
            made it more distortion free, less susceptible to bending in high speeds, and less likely to open in the event
            of an accident. Shoei also incorporated a five-stage adjustment dial that allows the rider to fine-tune the
            base plate's function in keeping with the design focus on aerodynamics and ventilation. Shoei pointed out that
            the X-Spirit III was developed with input from top racers like Marc Marquez and Bradley Smith. While most riders
            who spend the €799 (US$900) for the highest-priced version of this helmet will never reach the level of either
            one of these guys, they'll at least know their noggin is covered by a helmet that even the best feel comfortable wearing.
